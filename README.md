# Quasar Skynet Benchmark

See [here](https://github.com/atemerev/skynet).

## Getting started

Optionally adjust the JVM settings and main class at the end of `build.gradle` (`Skynet` is the idiomatic version and `SkynetChannels` is the channels-based one, closer to the Go program). Then:

```
./gradlew
```
